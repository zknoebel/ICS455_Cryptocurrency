========================================
balance  exit  help  mine  transaction  verify


Starting with the Genesis Block.

(CLR)help balance
Get the balance for a specific account

usage:
balance <block_chain_file> <account>

(CLR)balance sampleFiles/GenesisBlock.json wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY
wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY has 100000000000 ICS-455-Cryptocurrency

To make it easier to follow along we will use a name instead of a hash for sender and receiver

(CLR)help transaction
Create a transaction file

usage
transaction <sender> <receiver> <amount> <signature> <new_file_name>

Make a transaction
(CLR)transaction wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY Abby 1000 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29 sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file0
Make a transaction
(CLR)transaction wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY Bob 1001 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29 sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file1
Make a transaction
(CLR)transaction wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY Charles 1002 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29 sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file2
Make a transaction
(CLR)transaction wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY Donna 1003 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29 sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file3
Make a transaction
(CLR)transaction wvfYvNSFAwOFVV4B3o1kxsSY Edd 1004 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29 sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file4


Now that we have some transactions, we can mine some blocks

(CLR)help mine
Mine a block

usage:
mine <current_block_chain_file> <transaction_file>
or
mine <current_block_chain_file> <transaction_file> <file_to_save_to>


Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/GenesisBlock.json sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file0 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 79
hash of newly mined block = 8e0c7b7ed06971d65d7d7f56b7387aa457c676300f116cb5ba36d250a8bd8501


Now a block has been mined and added to the block chain.
Lets verify this new block chain.


(CLR)help verify
Verify a block chain

usage:
verify <filename_to_verify>


(CLR)verify sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
Block at index 0 has been verified.
Block at index 1 has been verified.
All hashes have been verified

Now that we know that it works, lets mine a few more

Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/sample_block_chain sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file0 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 22
hash of newly mined block = e1ea222e556f950f49526741dbd5dd727a3fb92349e5f31d461b7f3ddd443902
Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/sample_block_chain sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file1 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 104
hash of newly mined block = 009ab3b4a9502f2275b786275d2af8aa4126a3c77b10ce3d2af3711ab5f18cf3
Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/sample_block_chain sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file2 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 28
hash of newly mined block = 81371fe42e86d79e1be1f490d098fc2b0738b3f2fef5efe241483054aa591dd4
Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/sample_block_chain sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file3 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 7
hash of newly mined block = 4254c3b1f9d357985365a475a70d0b3077787c9311f5fbf0c02ea28bc85fd835
Mine a block
(CLR)mine sampleFiles/sample_block_chain sampleFiles/sample_transaction_file4 sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
proof of newly mined block = 13
hash of newly mined block = bf8344b3fce0f3c8ea3d71dcf1ee8d114372f77871be545753add7adc8005c56

As you can see, the index of the end of the block's hash has to match the index of the block.
This automatically increases the hardness of the proof of work as more blocks are mined.

Now verify the entire chain
(CLR)verify sampleFiles/sample_block_chain
Block at index 0 has been verified.
Block at index 1 has been verified.
Block at index 2 has been verified.
Block at index 3 has been verified.
Block at index 4 has been verified.
Block at index 5 has been verified.
Block at index 6 has been verified.
All hashes have been verified
